This repository contains my implementations for several machine learning algorithms:

1. Naive Bayes text classifier- naive_bayes.py
2. Maximum Entropy text classifier (logistic regression model with stochastic gradient descent and Early stopping)- maxent.py
3. Hidden Markov Model for sequential tagging- hmm.py

I included some of the needed utility modules, but the general explanation behind each implementation can be found in the above mentioned files as comments.
